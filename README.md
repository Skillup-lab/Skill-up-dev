 🌍 Why Skill Up?

Skill Up supports the idea that quality education doesn't have to come from big institutions. There are teachers all around us—in our streets, churches, mosques, schools, homes—waiting for the opportunity to teach.

We believe:
- Learning should start *locally*
- Teaching should be *empowered*
- Communities should *grow together*
